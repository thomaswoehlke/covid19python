        ECDC switched to a weekly reporting schedule for the COVID-19 situation worldwide and in the EU/EEA
        and the UK on 17 December 2020. Hence, all daily updates have been discontinued from 14 December.
        ECDC will publish updates on the number of cases and deaths reported worldwide and aggregated
        by week every Thursday. The weekly data will be available as downloadable files in the following formats:
        XLSX, CSV, JSON and XML.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the switch from daily to weekly reporting, ECDC will shift its Epidemic Intelligence (EI) resources
        from case counting to signal/event detection and resume its regular EI activities, which will include
        COVID-19 signal and event detection and analysis but also other potential threats.
