                    ECDC switched to a weekly reporting schedule for the COVID-19 situation worldwide and in the EU/EEA
                    and the UK on 17 December 2020. Hence, all daily updates have been discontinued from 14 December.
                    ECDC will publish updates on the number of cases and deaths reported worldwide and aggregated
                    by week every Thursday. The weekly data will be available as downloadable files in the following formats:
                    XLSX, CSV, JSON and XML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the switch from daily to weekly reporting, ECDC will shift its Epidemic Intelligence (EI) resources
                    from case counting to signal/event detection and resume its regular EI activities, which will include
                    COVID-19 signal and event detection and analysis but also other potential threats.
